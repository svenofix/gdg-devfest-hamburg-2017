**Join the AppFest and build an app in a day!**

Learn how to spend less time on infrastructure and more time on building the features that your users care about.

Start the day by learning about Firebase and Cloud Functions. Then put it into practice during our afternoon Hackathon and competition. **We'll have Firebase engineers and experts around to help you turn your idea into an app** by having your application code talk directly to Firebase's managed back-end services. And in the cases where you need server-side logic, use Cloud Functions - Firebase's scalable serverless solution.

**We can't wait to see what you build next.**

To take part in the competition and win prices you need to comply with the following rules:

 - **New creation** - no ports of existing apps
 - **Make use of Firebase** - the more, the better
 - **Open source** - from the beginning
 - The final webapp (or APK or iOS app) **must be be stored in Firebase Hosting with a link in the submission form.**

The app idea and code belong to the team, and they can do whatever they want with it afterward. As a gesture of goodwill we would like for that repo to be publicly available for a while so we can promote it as an example.


<div style="margin-top:4em; margin-bottom:1em;"><img src="/images/ic_thumb_yellow.png" style="float:left; display: inline-block;"/><h1 style="margin-left:1.8em">Jury</h1></div>
The jury will have mixed expertise in Web, Android and iOS development and consist of (exact names tba):

 - **2 Firebase engineers from Google**
 - **1 Firebase GDE**
 - **2 community members from Hamburg**

They will accompany the whole hackathon and also act as mentors to get you going. At the end of the hackathon they will judge projects according to the following criteria:

 - **15 points - Effective overall use of Firebase (number of components used creatively)**
Crash Reporting and Analytics don't count toward number of components!
 - **5 points - Technical difficulty and competence**
 - **5 points - Awesomeness factor**
